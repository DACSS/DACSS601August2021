## Introduction
We can do basic arithmetic very easily in R. Let's start with addition.

## Adddition
You can use R as a calculator to do addition, using `+` the same way you would on a standard calculator.
```{r addition}
4+4
8+9
```

## Subtraction
```{r subtraction}
10-8
9-6
```

## Multiplication
``` {r multiplication}
5*3
4*2
```

## Division
``` {r division}
9/3
40/6
```
