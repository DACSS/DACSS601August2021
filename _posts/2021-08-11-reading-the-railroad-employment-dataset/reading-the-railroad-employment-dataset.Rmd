```{r my setup}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
State_county <- read_excel("../../_data/StateCounty2012.xls", skip=3)
```

I have downloaded the excel file and initially I try to see the data structure. 

```{r}
head(State_county)
tail(State_county)
```

The data needs to be cleaned for further analysis.

```{r}
State_county <- select(State_county, -c(2, 4))
State_county <- State_county[-c(2985, 2987, 2989), ]
State_county <- State_county[complete.cases(State_county),]
head(State_county)
tail(State_county)
```

Now it looks better!
