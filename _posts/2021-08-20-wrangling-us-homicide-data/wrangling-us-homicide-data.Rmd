Loading packages necessary for wrangling:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

Importing the data and assigning it to variable homi:

**you will need to fill in the direct URL to the dataset you wish to use, similar to what I
did with the executions data.**

If you are using Kaggle data, you may need to use the API/R Package to access it directly. https://github.com/mkearney/kaggler

If that doesn't work, there is another workaround for accessing datasets from Kaggle or other URL sources: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55272909/read-dataset-from-kaggle


```{r}
#homi <- read.csv("")
#head(homi)
```
