#Reading in my data. This set contains monthly Federal Reserve interest rates from 1954-2017. It also contains the quarterly inflation rates, and monthly unemployment rates. I downloaded this data from Kaggle. Raw data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/federalreserve/interest-rates)

```{r}
fed_rates <- read_csv("C:/Users/Benja/Documents/GitHub/DACSS601August2021/_data/FedFundsRate.csv")
```

#Changing numeric values to names of the month 

```{r}
fed_rates <- fed_rates %>%
  mutate(Month = case_when(
         Month == 1 ~ "January",
         Month == 2 ~ "February",
         Month == 3 ~ "March",
         Month == 4 ~ "April",
         Month == 5 ~ "May",
         Month == 6 ~ "June",
         Month == 7 ~ "July",
         Month == 8 ~ "August", 
         Month == 9 ~ "September",
         Month == 10 ~ "October",
         Month == 11 ~ "November",
         Month == 12 ~ "December")
  )

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
