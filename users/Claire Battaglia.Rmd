Everything begins with foodâ€”from our individual health to the health of our communities and of the land that feeds us. **I use data to craft research-driven policy to effect change within our food system.**

Based in Missoula, Montana, I spend my free time trail running with my German Wirehaired Pointer, mountaineering, and just generally playing outside.

*"First we eat, then we do everything else."*
