**Here's some R code that makes a graph!**

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
x_vals <- seq(1, 100)
y_vals <- sort(rnorm(100))
mean.y <- mean(y_vals)
sd.y <- sd(y_vals)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
print("This is the mean of the y values: ")
print(format(mean.y))
print("This is the standard deviation of the y values: ")
print(toString(sd.y))
ggplot(data = NULL, mapping = aes(x_vals, y_vals)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Just some random data")
```
